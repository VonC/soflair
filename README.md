SOFlair
=======

Soflair is a (*very*) simple widget for Android that shows a user's flair (avatar, reputation & badges) on any of the stackexchange sites (e.g. Stackoverflow, Serverfault, Superuser, etc.). The JSON feed is polled every 60 minutes.

The widget is available on the [Android Market][1] and some other information is in [this blog entry][2].
